# SchedulePlanner

- As a developer, I want to create a daily schedule that allow users to utilize the save event tool in hourly manner and help users to manage their daily paln.

## Instruction

- When load to the page, today's date will be loaded at the top portion of the page.
- The calendar provide an empty planner from 9am to 6pm.
- For easier distinction on past, present, and future plan, the hours are color-coded which the past hours are in grey, the current hour is in red, and the future hours are in green.
- The empty text area next to each hours allow users to input their daily plan.
- The users input will be saved once the save buttons located next to each text area is clicked on.
- Once the users input is saved, it’ll remain in the corresponding text area even after the page refresh.
